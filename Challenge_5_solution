Question 1:
Staff 1 and 2, who had the most transactions: how many transactions did each staff handle and who gets the bonus?

SELECT staff_id, COUNT(*) FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;

Results:
1	7292
2	7304

So staff 2 would get the bonus


Question 2:
What is the average replacement cost per MPAA ratings?

SELECT rating, AVG(replacement_cost) FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating

OR (if wanting rounded)
SELECT rating, ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2) FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating


Question 3:
What are the customer ids of the top 5 customers by total spend?

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
